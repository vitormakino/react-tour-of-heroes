This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It's based on 
[The Tour of Heroes tutorial from the fundamentals of Angular](https://angular.io/tutorial).

This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

The following diagram captures all of the navigation options.
